OpenStreetMap Hall Monitor
==========================

This module is a passive changeset monitoring tool for use with OpenStreetMap.

To begin use, simply call `import osmhm` after installation.

Sample calls available for now:

```
import osmhm


```

More information will be coming soon and the tool will continue to be improved, including the option to remove the dependency on psycopg2 and a postgres database to store everything.
